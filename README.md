# image-colorization

The project aims to color black and white images via Machine Learning without any human supervision. More specifically, 
the project uses anime (One-Piece) manga data to train the colorization algorithm. The project is far from completion, 
and is being worked upon actively by me. The case of colorizing a black and white comic may seem impractical and not useful 
to some. But since the algorithm is trained only based on data, and without any domain knowledge of comics specifically, it
should directly carry on to more useful cases, like colorizing historical photographs and likely cases. Also, colorizing manga 
and comics is a very hard and work-intensive tasks. Such an application, if it reaches current human level, can have many real-world
use cases.
